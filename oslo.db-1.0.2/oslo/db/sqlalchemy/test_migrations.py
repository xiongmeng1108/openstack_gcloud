    This is only suitable for testing of migrate_ migration scripts. An
    abstract class mixin. `INIT_VERSION`, `REPOSITORY` and `migration_api`
    attributes must be implemented in subclasses.

    .. _auxiliary-dynamic-methods: Auxiliary Methods

    Auxiliary Methods:

    `migrate_up` and `migrate_down` instance methods of the class can be
    used with auxiliary methods named `_pre_upgrade_<revision_id>`,
    `_check_<revision_id>`, `_post_downgrade_<revision_id>`. The methods
    intended to check applied changes for correctness of data operations.
    This methods should be implemented for every particular revision
    which you want to check with data. Implementation recommendations for
    `_pre_upgrade_<revision_id>`, `_check_<revision_id>`,
    `_post_downgrade_<revision_id>` implementation:

        * `_pre_upgrade_<revision_id>`: provide a data appropriate to
           a next revision. Should be used an id of revision which
           going to be applied.

        * `_check_<revision_id>`: Insert, select, delete operations
           with newly applied changes. The data provided by
           `_pre_upgrade_<revision_id>` will be used.

        * `_post_downgrade_<revision_id>`: check for absence
          (inability to use) changes provided by reverted revision.

    Execution order of auxiliary methods when revision is upgrading:

        `_pre_upgrade_###` => `upgrade` => `_check_###`

    Execution order of auxiliary methods when revision is downgrading:

        `downgrade` => `_post_downgrade_###`
